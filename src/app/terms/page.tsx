        <p>
          Please read these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) carefully
          before using the LeadsPilotAI website and services (the
          &quot;Service&quot;) operated by LeadsPilotAI (&quot;we,&quot;
          &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). Your access to and use of the
          Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with
          these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above
          the age of 18 and that the information you provide is accurate,
          complete, and current. You are responsible for safeguarding your
          password.

        <h2>2. The Service</h2>
        <p>
          LeadsPilotAI provides an AI-powered chatbot assistant
          (&quot;Clyde&quot;) that can be embedded on your website. You are
          solely responsible for the content you provide for the AI&apos;s
          training and for your interactions with your website visitors
          (&quot;End-Users&quot;). You agree to comply with all applicable laws
          regarding the data you collect from your End-Users.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payment</h2>
        <p>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis. You will
          be billed in advance on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly).
          Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled. We use a
          third-party payment processor (Stripe) to handle all payments.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Lifetime Charter Offer</h2>
        <p>
          Our &quot;Lifetime Charter&quot; plan is a one-time fee for lifetime
          access to the features defined in the &quot;Prestige&quot; plan at the
          time of purchase. This offer is subject to a recurring monthly
          maintenance and API fee to cover ongoing operational costs.
          &quot;Lifetime&quot; refers to the lifetime of the LeadsPilotAI
          product.

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall LeadsPilotAI, nor its directors or employees, be
          liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
          punitive damages, including loss of profits or data, resulting from
          your use of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We
          will provide at least 30 days&apos; notice prior to any new terms
