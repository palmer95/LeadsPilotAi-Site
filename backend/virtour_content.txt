Terms



                                1) Background: This Agreement is between the Photography Service Provider (VirTour Media LLC) and the Business whose premises are being photographed for the purpose of selling the property (or the Business who has attained written permission to market the property for this purpose).
2) Service Fee Payment: Service Provider, VirTour Media LLC, and Business will agree on an amount for the Photos and related services (a Service Fee), and the Business will pay the one time Service Fee at the time of signing this agreement, or no less than 3 business days after the Business publishes the service provider's photographs or other marketing materials ordered by the Business. This is a one time Photography Service Fee. You will not receive any recurring charges for the services provided by VirTour Media LLC unless recurring products from the order form are selected. Should you want additional services offered by VirTour Media LLC after your photography services have published then and only then will you be billed for additional services.
3) If the Business, (the party agreeing to our service terms & receiving the associated marketing materials with this order) does not pay VirTour Media LLC for the marketing materials within the 3-day time frame agreed upon in element 2) of our Terms of Use, the Business is subject to a compounding 25% monthly interest fee on the order. For example, if an order has a $1,000 balance, the Business publishes the Service Provider's marketing materials on the 1st of a month, & the Business does not pay the Service Provider, VirTour Media LLC, by the 1st of the following month, that order now has a balance of $1,250 subject to the 25% compounding monthly interest fee every month after that the balance on the order has still not been paid.
4) If a shoot needs to be shot across multiple days for any reason, $150 will be added to the order to cover additional time required for media services
5) Services and Ownership of Photographs: In exchange for the Service Fee: Service Provider will provide marketing materials of the premises as ordered. Service Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Photographs meet the MLS technical specifications; Service Provider hereby keeps all ownership rights to the marketing materials produced (including intellectual property rights). You hereby grant Virtour Media LLC and our affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, without compensation to you or others, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute the marketing materials delivered, or any portion thereof, throughout the world in any format, media or distribution method (whether now known or hereafter created) for the duration of any copyright or other rights in the marketing materials delivered. Such permission will be perpetual and may not be revoked for any reason, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Further, to the extent permitted under applicable law, you waive and release and covenant not to assert any moral rights that you may have in the marketing materials delivered. If you identify yourself by name or provide a picture or audio or video recording of yourself, you further authorize us and our affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, without compensation to you or others, to reproduce, print, publish and disseminate in any format or media (whether now known or hereafter created) your name, voice and likeness throughout the world, and such permission will be perpetual and cannot be revoked for any reason, except as required by applicable law. You further agree that we may use the marketing materials delivered in any manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.
6) Limited License to Business: Service Provider grants Business a nonexclusive license to reasonably use the marketing materials provided under this Agreement for the purposes of marketing the property.
7) Time and Date of Services: Upon signatures, Services Provider will reserve the time and date agreed upon to provide the photographic services. All Service Fees are non-refundable except as described in Section 8 below, or unless Service Provider agrees in its sole discretion to permit a rescheduling of the services. A $100 rescheduling fee will be applied if the photographer travels to the property and cannot provide services.
8) Refunds: Service Provider will refund all pre-paid Service Fees to the Business (but will have no further liability with respect to the Agreement) if efforts to re-shoot or fix issues cannot be met. VirTour Media LLC provides a checklist for homeowners to get their houses ready for photos. VirTour Media LLC is not responsible for clutter or unmovable objects unwanted in photos. Refunds will NOT be issued if home is not ready per the checklist guidelines. Refunds are NOT available for virtually staged & renovated images delivered by the Service Provider, that are not satisfactory to either the Business, the client placing the order, &/or the home owner.
9) Confidentiality: This Agreement is confidential information.
